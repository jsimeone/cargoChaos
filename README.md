If using XCode
1. Clone this repository into the main directory of your XCode project file (one level deeper than the .xcodeproj file. MAKE SURE THIS DIRECTORY IS EMPTY!) using `git clone URL .` (the dot is important!)

2. Set custom Xcode working directory by navigating to Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme and switching working directory to the same folder you cloned the repository into.
